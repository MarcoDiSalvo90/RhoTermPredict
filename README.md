# RhoTermPredict

RhoTermPredict algorithm in python language

RhoTermPredict is an algorithm for the prediction of Rho-dependent transcription terminators in bacterial genomes. It searchs for a putative RUT site followed by a putative pause site for RNA polymerase.

INPUT: genome sequences file in fasta format

OUTPUT: a txt file containing the coordinates of predicted Rho-dependent terminators and another txt file cointaining some informations about predictions
